# 📊 Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on their financial and personal information. Accurate prediction of loan defaults can help financial institutions manage risk and make informed lending decisions.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective is to build a classification model that can identify potential loan defaulters using features like credit score, income, employment type, education level, and more. The model will be trained on historical loan data and evaluated using performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm

We use a **Random Forest Classifier**, an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting. It works well with both numerical and categorical data and provides feature importance analysis.
